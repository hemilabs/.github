# Security Policy

At Hemi Labs, we consider security a fundamental part of our network. We value the security of our network and our
users, however no matter how much effort we put into security, there could still be vulnerabilities hiding.

## Supported Versions

<!-- If this project provides security patches for older releases, please modify the following accordingly -->

Security patches will be provided **only** for the latest release of this project. This policy ensures that security
updates are concentrated on the most up-to-date and stable version of the project. **Older versions will not receive
security patches.**

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover vulnerabilities in Hemi, we encourage responsible disclosure of the vulnerability so that we can take
steps to resolve the vulnerability as quickly as possible. We ask you to help us better protect Hemi and our users by
reporting vulnerabilities through HackerOne. **Never report security vulnerabilities publicly, especially on GitHub
issues.**

When reporting a vulnerability, the more information you can provide, the faster we can triage and confirm the reported
vulnerability. Reports with clear and concise reproduction steps and screenshots are highly valued.

You can report a security vulnerability by:
- [Submitting a report through Hemi's HackerOne VDP program](https://hackerone.com/hemi_labs_vdp)

## Responsible Disclosure

- Please do not discuss any vulnerabilities outside of our HackerOne programs without express consent from Hemi Labs.
- Follow our program [disclosure policy](https://hackerone.com/hemi_labs_vdp).
- Follow HackerOne's [disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/terms/disclosure-guidelines).
